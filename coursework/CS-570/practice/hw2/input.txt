There are 82 different Rubik’s Cubes scattered throughout my house. Each one tells a story. My Rubik’s cube from the Louvre in Paris resting on my bookshelf tells the story of that memorable July in 2007 that saw me turn my back on the Mona Lisa to set my gaze on that perfect 6-sided cube with its 54 stickers, ready to be mixed up into any one of its 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 permutations. 
The Dayan Zhanchi 3x3 cube in the drawer of my desk tells the story of when I had to create left-handed algorithms to solve the cube since all the ones online were right-handed, when I stayed up for hours fixated upon the cube while others were bunched up on their phones, and when I taught my friends how to solve it.
The Moyu Aolong V2 cube from Amazon that resides on my bookshelf tells the story of little freshman me walking around during lunch, challenging any kid who had a cube of their own and indoctrinating those who did not into purchasing one to join my expanding movement. 
The Master Pyraminx next to my computer’s keyboard tells the story of when I had to mark the green face of the puzzle with black dots to differentiate it from yellow after being mocked in class for being colorblind. 
The WitEden 3x3x9 sitting on my keyboard’s music stand tells the story of my three week online hunt in search of a blue plastic variation of the puzzle, finding one on a German website and working out overseas shipping. 
The pile of plastic and apoxie sculpt on my desk that I call a clover octahedron fragmentation tells the story of the summer of my junior year when I designed and built my own puzzles due to the full mastery of the others I possessed.
For others, these puzzles are simply toys where the solution can be found online. But for me, they hold the memories of a life fabricated by my own creative solutions to my own unique problems, all just to solve that classic puzzle.
