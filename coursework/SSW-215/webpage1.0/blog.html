					<h3>Less Than Zero Hulu Series</h3>
					<h6>11:38am January 31 2019</h6>
				<p>
					Believe it or not, I know absolutely nothing about the production of this series. All I know is that I have gotten a hefty penny for the licensing fee. The episodes should come out at some point in 2019 and will probably be rated for mature audiences. I really hope this adaptation is better than the film adaptation they made for it back in 1987. Anyways, we'll see what happens and be sure to check back here for my opinion on it when it comes out.

    				<h3>Note From Hayden</h3>

				<p>
					The reason I made a site about this author instead of myself is because I have recently become a large fan of his writing. I started with American Psycho when I first visited NY to tour colleges and the book made me feel very immersed within the city. My second experience with his writing was when I read Less Than Zero on my flight back home from my first semester at Stevens. The parallels between the main character of the book and me made the book incredible. It was based on a kid returning from his first semester of college on the East Coast to the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles which was the exact situation I was in. Since then, over the winter break, I have read three more of his books and can't wait to finish the rest of them. That's the reason I chose his personal site for my assignment.
