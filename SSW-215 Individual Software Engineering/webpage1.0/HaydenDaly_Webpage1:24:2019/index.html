          Believe it or not, I know absolutely nothing about the production of this series. All I know is that I have gotten a hefty penny for the licensing fee. The episodes should come out at some point in 2019 and will probably be rated for mature audiences. I really hope this adaptation is better than the film adaptation they made for it back in 1987. Anyways, we'll see what happens and be sure to check back here for my opinion on it when it comes out.

          The reason I made a site about this author instead of myself is because I have recently become a large fan of his writing. I started with <em>American Psycho</em> when I first visited NY to tour colleges and the book made me feel very immersed within the city. My second experience with his writing was when I read <em>Less Than Zero</em> on my flight back home from my first semester at Stevens. The parallels between the main character of the book and me made the book incredible. It was based on a kid returning from his first semester of college on the East Coast to the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles which was the exact situation I was in. Since then, over the winter break, I have read three more of his books and can't wait to finish the rest of them. That's the reason I chose his personal site for my assignment.

            Hello, I was born on<br> March 7th, 1964 in<br> LA, California. I went<br> to Bennington for<br> college, initially a<br> music major, and<br> wrote my first book, <em>Less Than Zero</em>,<br> when I was 21. Most<br> people classify me as<br> a post-modern author<br> but i'd like to consider<br> myself a satirist.
