# The Unbearable Automaticity of Being

## Intro

Unconscious behvaiors are studied in psych:
	- Freud said behavior to be determined by biological impulses and unconscious interplay. The individual is unaware of these intrapsychic struggles and their causal effect on the individual's behavior.
	- Skinner/Watson (Early behaviorist theory) said behavior is outside conscious control but placed the control on external stimulus conditions and events.
	- Roger/Kelly (Self theory and humanist movement) think causal self is mediator between environment and responses to it. This perspective remains dominant among theories of motivation and self regulation. Contemporary cognitive perspective accounts for phenomenon as deterministic mechanisms. They are caused jointly by processes set into motion by one's environment and by processes instigated by acts of conscious choice. There are conscious and unconscious actions.

### Conscious Process

Mental acts of which we are aware, that we intend, that require effort, and that we can control.

### Automatic Process:

Two major ideas:
	1. Intentional but effortless mental processes
	2. Takes place effortlessly but without any intention or often awareness taking place.

Example:
	Aware automatic is automated flight control systems.
	Unaware automatic is a receiver for phone messages.

Automated processes advance society by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking.

## Perceiving Is for Doing

Humans have an innate capacity for imitative behavior and vicarious learning leading theorists to argue there must be an association between the representation of viewing and doing behaviors.

Thinking about an action increases likelihood of it occurring.

### Automatic Perception Induces the Ideas

Perception is the route which the environment directly causes mental activity.

Social perception of individuals and groups is largely unconscious and automated.

### The Perception-Behavior Link

Environment controls perception which influences behavior. Hence media has a mechanism which influences behavior. I.e. seeing an aggressive character can make a viewer unconciously aggresive.
