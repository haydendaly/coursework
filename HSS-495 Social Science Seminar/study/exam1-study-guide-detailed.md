# Exam 1

## Mason (2018)

Sorting
    - Define = social division along partisan lines (Explain)
        * People categorize themselves into groups by some detail of identity
    - What does it mean in the real world? What evidence / examples exist?
        * Partisan, ideological, religous, and racial identities.
        * Evidence (Mason5-6.pdf, Page 3)

Cross-pressures / Cross-cutting identities
    - What are they?
        * Conflicting values in individuals and groups. People feel they identify with a group but only some aspects.
    - What is their impact (if both high and low)? (Mason1.pdf, Page 9-10)
    - Compare with role of policy agreement (Mason1.pdf, Page 6)

Partisan ambivalence
    * Where political parties force comprimises. Cognitive dissonance.

Minimal group paradigm (Mason1.pdf, Page 12-14)
    - Explanation and outcomes / examples from research
        * Discrimination between groups naturally arises out of a simple conflict of interest between them.
        * Dots on a screen.

Motivated reasoning
    - Definition
        * The process by which individuals rationalize their choices in a way that is consistent with what they prefer to believe, rather than with what is actually true.
    - Relationship to Bargh & Chartrand
        * Unconcious mechanism, they are unaware and it is their innate response to something.

Affective Polarization / Social Polarization
    * AP is the growth of dislike between republicans and democrats since the 1970s.
    * SP is segregation that arises from income inequality, racial differences, and other factors creating social divides.

Emotion (Mason5-6.pdf, Page 13-16)
    - Affective Intelligence Theory
    - Anger, Anxiety, Enthusiasm (impacts on cognition and action)
        * Anxiety leads to more thoughful processing of information. Citizens search out mre information but in a biased way, especially for threatening information.
        * Anger leads to more reliance on easily available cues such as social identities. Drives action. More inclined to sign petitions, register other people to voite, participate in protests, volunteer for campaigns, and donate. Also causes for more racial decision making.
        * Enthusiasm increases likelihood of urging others to vote, wearing a political button, attending rallies, and donating to a candiate or party.
    - Sorting & emotional reactivity (Mason5-6.pdf, Page 15-16)

## Bargh & Chartrand (1999)

Conscious process (Bargh&Chartrand.pdf, Page 2)
    * Mental acts of which we are aware, that we intend, that require effort, and that we can control.

Automatic process (Bargh&Chartrand.pdf, Page 2-3)
    - Goal-directed
        * Intentional but effortless mental processes.
            Ex. Aware automatic is automated flight control systems.
    - Preattentive / preconscious
        * Takes place effortlessly but without any intention or often awareness taking place.
            Ex. Unaware automatic is a receiver for phone messages.

Ego-depletion / Self-control (Bargh&Chartrand.pdf, Page 3-4)
    - What is it? Examples?
        * An act of self-control in one domain seriously depletes a person's ability to engage in self-control in a subsequent, entirely unrelated domain.
        * Table 1 has examples

Emotion (Bargh&Chartrand.pdf, Page 12-14)
    - "largely not a matter of conscious choice"
    - Perception -> Evaluation link (aka "hot cognition")
    - Implicity Association Test (IAT)
        - Speed of association between prime and target words

Figures 1-3 (Bargh&Chartrand.pdf, Page 5, 8, 9)

## Comstock & Sharrer (2005)

Third Person Effect
    - What is it? (Comstock1.pdf, Page 1)
        * The inclination of people to assert that others are or have been or will be influenced by the stimuli presented by the mass media while they themselves remain beyond and--in their minds above such manipulation.
    - How strong is the evidence? (Comstock1.pdf, Page 3)
    - Role of social disparity (Comstock1.pdf, Page 5)

Conformity
    - Spiral of silence
        - What is it? (Comstock1.pdf, Page 10)
            * Majority opinion can silence minority opinion. Absence of social support and severity of likely sanctions perpetuate this.
            * Publish polls and media perpetuate what is perceived as a political majority silencing others.
        - Role of media/news?
            * Media coverage is perceived as public opinion so a biased media perspective can silence and marginalized opposing political stances.

Consequences of Survey Methods (Comstock1.pdf, Page 18)

Personal Experience: Role of Opinion Leaders (Comstock1.pdf, Page 23, 27)
    * Opinion leaders filter information and disseminate it to others. They usually shared the same outlook and perspective with who they converse with. This resulted in most information reaching the individual had a friendly and reinforcing person behind it.
    * Conduit role (greater access to media) and consultant role (they have perceived expertise) lead to opinion leaders.
    * They're found in all groups and exemplify socialization.

Partisanship
    - Four "laws" (Comstock1.pdf, Page 26)
        1. Early decision making
        2. Party loyalty
        3. Regression to the past
        4. Reinfrocement from the mass media

Key Developments in Political Media (Historically) (Comstock2.pdf, Page 1-8)

Four Dimensions of Objectivity in News Coverage (Comstock2.pdf, Page 7)
    1. Accuracy (adherance to the fact and identifying uncertainities)
    2. Inclusiveness (Full coverage of facts facorable to or another of the various sides or perspectives in controversy)
    3. Fairness (The roughly equal treatment of opposing sides, candidates, and parties when a correct or preferred resolution is ambiguous)
    4. Only selected stories are covered by the media (based on personal judgement and provider values)

## Young (2020)

Key Events in Conservative Media Timeline (I&O, Page 8-31)

Fairness Doctrine

Key Events in Development of Political Satire
    * Lenny Bruce, Mort Sal (Late 50s, Early 60s)
	* San Fran Coffee Houses
    * The Committee 1963
    * Secondy City
    * Lenny Bruce -> George Carlin
    * Smother Brother's Comedy Hours
    * SNL evolved into actors for SNL like Bill Murray, Chris Farley, and others
    * Last Week Tonight, Colbert Show, Jon Stewart Mentoring others

## Iyengar Et Al. (2019)

Affective Polarization (Definition & Examples) (Iyengar.pdf, Page 2)
    * Democrats and Republicans both say that the other partyâ€™s members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines, or even to partner withopponents in a variety of other activities. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties isknown as affective polarization.

3 Methods of Measurement (Iyengar.pdf, Page 3-5)
    - Explain each and their weaknesses
        * Survey Self-Reports
        * Implicit Measures
        * Behavioral Measures

Role of Partisan News in Causation of Affective Polarization (Iyengar.pdf, Page 7)
    * Those who are the most polarized watch partisan news. So partisan news doesn't make much impact on polarization. However, Levendusky finds that exposure to partisan news makes those with extreme attitutdes even more extreme.

Effects on Behavior and How to Combat Affective Polarization (Iyengar.pdf, Page 11-13)
